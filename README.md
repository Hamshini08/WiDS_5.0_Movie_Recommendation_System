# WiDS_5.0_Movie_Recommendation_System
A content based movie-recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on metadata like genre, cast, keywords, plot overview etc.
This project focuses on building a Content-Based Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies similar to a selected movie by analyzing movie metadata such as genre, cast, crew, keywords, and plot overview.
The system identifies similarities between movies based on their content features using basic NLP and vectorization techniques.

         It includes:
         -Python basics and data structures
         -Libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
         -Exploratory analysis of movie datasets
