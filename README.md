# WiDS_5.0_Movie_Recommendation_System
A content based movie-recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on metadata like genre, cast, keywords, plot overview etc.
This project focuses on building a Content-Based Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies similar to a selected movie by analyzing movie metadata such as genre, cast, crew, keywords, and plot overview.
The system identifies similarities between movies based on their content features using basic NLP and vectorization techniques.

## What I Learned Through This Project

### Week 1: Foundations of Python & Data Science

The first week of the project was dedicated to building a strong foundation in Python.  
The focus was on understanding core programming concepts that are essential for data analysis and machine learning.

### Week 2: Learning essential Python libraries

**This includes:**
- **NumPy** for numerical computations
- Using **Pandas** for data manipulation and analysis
- Data Visualisation by **Matplotlib**
- Exploratory data analysis of movie datasets  
- Classification of movies based on their genres  


### Week 3: NLP & Recommendation System Concepts

**This includes:**
- Understanding and implementing **Count Vectorizer**
- Measuring similarity using **Cosine Similarity**
- Merging multiple datasets into a **master dataset**
- Text preprocessing techniques in **NLP**, including:
  - Tokenization
  - Stemming
  - Lemmatization
- Extracting meaningful features from text data such as plot summaries, keywords, cast, and crew.
